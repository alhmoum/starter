# Starter
> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

A simple front-end skeleton without any tooling. Just start and add tooling as needed.

You can use all the latest JavaScript features, like `async`/`await` and ESM modules in all ever green browsers.


## Tooling

Need TypeScript/Babel/SCSS? Add a `src` folder for your source files and have tools output to `public`.

Another option is to use [unpkg](http://unpkg.com).
